            <h3 class="title">A Brief History of Dogs</h3>
            <p>It all begins with the wolf. Around 12,000 to 14,000 years ago, possibly due to climate change, man and wolf began to drift closer. </p>

            <p>Perhaps wolves, vying for more limited meat sources, were drawn to human camps for scraps. We’ll never know for sure how it began, but it’s commonly acknowledged that it was their pups that were first trained by humans.This was the start of a transition from wild to domesticated, and dogs as we know them today are descendants of those animals.There is evidence of dogs being treated with greater respect and even affection from here on. A late-period Palaeolithic tomb in northern Israel revealed a touching scene – a man buried with his dog, the man’s hand resting on the animal’s shoulder, suggesting a tender bond between them.</p>

            <p>As for pet ownership, this has a long history – but initially only among the noble classes. Murals from Ancient Egypt depict pharaohs keeping companion animals, and Greek and Roman nobility certainly kept pets. Dogs belonging to Chinese emperors were said to have human wet nurses when pups and, in adulthood, their own servants.Pet-keeping was not generally accepted in Europe until the end of the 17th century, with the middle classes embracing dogs in the 18th century. But it was the Victorians who firmly established the tradition, as well as many of the breeds we love today. The Kennel Club was founded in 1873, while Queen Victoria herself entered six pomeranians into the first Crufts Dog Show in 1891.</p>

            <p>Today, while some dogs are ornamental (think of Paris Hilton’s late chihuahua, Tinkerbell) or helpers (guide dogs, for example), most are simply much-loved companions. It’s well documented that having a furry friend – enjoying walks and cuddles and the warmth that comes with owning a pooch – can have positive, therapeutic effects on all our health and emotional well-being.</p>

            <h3 class="title">A Brief History of Cats</h3>
            <p>Thought to have descended from the African wildcat and used to catch vermin, the domestic cat can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt 4,000 years ago (and perhaps beyond). By helping to reduce disease and protect crops, cats were quickly regarded as sacred creatures by the Egyptians. </p>

            <p>After the Egyptian dynasty collapsed, cats became popular elsewhere. In the Far East, cats were originally owned by the rich. As their popularity grew, the domesticated cat made its way to surrounding countries like India and Japan. This is when breeding also began, with breeds such as the Siamese and Burmese first emerging</p>

            <p>It’s believed that Egyptian traders originally introduced cats to Europe, where the Greeks and the Romans used them as pest control. However, during the Middle Ages, cats in Europe became associated with superstition. During the Black Death of 1348, rulers ordered the killing of all cats, because they were suspected of carrying the disease. It wasn’t until the 1600s that their reputation started to recover.During the 15th and 16th century, cats were welcome cargo on ships to minimize vermin and disease. It’s commonly thought that when Christopher Columbus discovered America, cats from his ship went ashore and flourished. In fact, this is where the American Shorthair is rumored to have originated.</p>

            <p>Nowadays, cats are a key part of modern society – it’s estimated there are close to half a billion around the world. They continue to be an important and special part of our lives. We’re always looking for new ways to show them how much we care. So, actually, when you consider how revered cats were by the Egyptians – not much has actually changed.</p>
